# ARMOR(Adversarial Robustness and Machine Learning Operations Research)
This repository contains implementations of various adversarial attacks and defenses using popular machine learning frameworks and the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART).

# ARMOR: Machine Learning Security Testing Toolkit

Welcome to ARMOR - a comprehensive toolkit for testing and improving the security of machine learning models. This toolkit helps you assess vulnerabilities in your ML models and implement robust defenses against potential attacks.

## Features

- Implementation of common adversarial attacks:
  - Evasion attacks (FGSM)...
  - Poisoning attacks..
  - Model inversion attacks...
- Defense mechanisms:
  - Adversarial training
  - Defensive distillation
  - Input randomization
  - Detection and rejection of adversarial examples

## Installation

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Train the base model:
```bash
python src/train.py --model cnn --dataset mnist
```

2. Run adversarial attacks:
```bash
python src/attacks/evasion.py --model-path models/base_model.h5 --attack fgsm
```

3. Implement defenses:
```bash
python src/defenses/adversarial_training.py --model-path models/base_model.h5
```

## Example

```python
from src.attacks.evasion import FGSM
from src.defenses.adversarial_training import AdversarialTraining

# Load model and data
model = load_model('models/base_model.h5')
x_train, y_train = load_mnist_data()

# Generate adversarial examples
attack = FGSM(model, epsilon=0.1)
x_adv = attack.generate(x_train)

# Train with adversarial defense
defense = AdversarialTraining(model)
model = defense.train(x_train, y_train, x_adv)
```

## What's This All About?

ARMOR helps you understand and improve the security of your machine learning models. It provides tools to:
- Test model resilience against various attacks
- Implement defense mechanisms
- Analyze model vulnerabilities
- Strengthen model robustness

## Core Features

1. **Model Testing** 
   ```python
   # Basic usage example:
   from armor.attacks import EvasionAttacks
   
   # Test if your model can be fooled
   attack = EvasionAttacks(your_model)
   results = attack.test_model_security()
   ```

2. **Model Hardening**
   ```python
   # Strengthen your model against attacks
   from armor.defenses import AdversarialTraining
   
   # Train a more robust model
   defender = AdversarialTraining(your_model)
   stronger_model = defender.train()
   ```

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**
   ```bash
   # Clone this repository
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd ARMOR

   # Install dependencies

   ```

2. **Dataset Setup**
   ```bash
   # Download and prepare datasets
   python src/utils/setup_datasets.py
   ```
